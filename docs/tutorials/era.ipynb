                "System realization encompasses the practice of using numerical methods to obtain a model of a system from experimental data of the system's response to an impulse. This realization, while derived from discrete-time data, should satisfy the system's continuous-time domain model as well. From this realization, a system's modal data can be derived.\n",

                "The Eigensystem Realization Algorithm ([ERA](../modules/era.html)) is a realization method used to identify a system's modal parameters from noisy measurement data [1]. A system's response to an impulse, such as a separation shock event, allows it to experience free decay, which contains useful frequency and modal damping information. ERA assembles impulse response data of the system into a block Hankel matrix and that matrix is manipulated to find the system modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping).\n",
                "\n",
                "The calculated modal responses produced by ERA can be reduced by a couple of means. The choice of how to arrange the system's data block matrix can help to filter out some signal noise and focus in on true modal responses. Carefully selecting the free-decay-only data can help this process, as can adjusting the tolerance level of the ERA procedure. It is highly recommended to run ERA multiple times while tweaking the inputs to gain confidence in the results.\n",
                "\n",
                "Additionally, there are some methods which can be used to identify system modes and differentiate them from noise. Four of these methods are used in this program, Mode Singular Value (MSV), Extended Modal Amplitude Coherence (EMAC), Modal Phase Collinearity (MPC), and Modal Amplitude Coherence (MAC). They are used in conjunction to provide more information regarding the importance of each detected mode to the approximation of the original signal.\n",

                "The EMAC of each mode ranges from a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, and is a temporal measure indicating the importance of the mode over time to the fit [2].  Higher values for a given mode indicate more importance to the overall response. From experience, the EMAC is superior to the MAC value (see below).\n",

                "The MPC of each mode ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 and is a spatial measure indicating whether or not the different response locations for a mode are in phase. Higher values indicate more “in-phase” measurements. This method is only useful if there are multiple outputs (MPC is 1.0 for single output).\n",

                "The MAC of each mode ranges from a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 and is a temporal measure indicating the importance of the mode over time to the fit, like the EMAC. A larger MAC value for a mode indicates that it plays an important role in approximating the fit of the realization model to the experimental data, while a lower value is less important and therefore more likely to be the product of noise. For our purposes, a MAC of 0.95 or higher is considered a strong indicator that a detected mode is a true system response rather than noise. The MAC value for a mode is the dot product of two vectors: (1) The ideal, reconstructed time history for a mode; (2) The time history extracted from the input data for the mode after discarding noisy data via singular value decomposition. From experience, this indicator is not as useful as the EMAC.",
